WebCenterADFBootstrapTheme
==========================

Sample portal application with base template and skin based on Twitter Bootstrap.  You can view the original details for this code at http://www.johnbrunswick.com/2013/02/webcenter-adf-twitter-bootstrap-theme/.

To view the theme in action, simply download the files and load the project in your local JDeveloper instance.  Launch the project by running the index.html file.

Additional Notes
==========================

- JDeveloper 11.1.1.6 was used to develop this project
- Some of the CSS3 syntax for the theme will not be understood by JDeveloper's CSS parser.  You can ignore the issues or use an external CSS editor (like Sublime Text 3)

Looking forward to seeing what modifications and adjustments may come of this project
